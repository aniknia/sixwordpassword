# Six Word Password

sixwordpassword is a simple website built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) that generates a secure password by randomly selecting six words from the EFF dictionary. Inspired by an xkcd comic on password strength, this project aims to combine security with memorability by using common words. Many other projects like Proton's password manager have added variation of this password generation method.

The EFF reccomend rolling several dice to choose a password, using this as inspiration I included an animation of rolling dice to convey the randomness of the password that is generated.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js:** A React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **Chakra UI:** A modular, accessible component library for React.
- **EFF Dictionary:** Utilized for its list of words for password generation.

## Inspiration

This project draws inspiration from an [xkcd comic](https://xkcd.com/936/) that shows the folley of secure passwords. Many are incredibly hard to remember leading users to pick easy to guess passwords and reuse them over multiple websites. Using multiple unrealted words leads to longer passwords that are significantly easy to remember.
